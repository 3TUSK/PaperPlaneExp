## What is it?

This is a simple experiment to demonstrate "how hard is to write a user manual?"   
All you need to do is to follow the steps below AS IT IS.  

Everyone that is over 12 is welcome. However, we prefer those with non-STEM background.

## How to?

  1. Get a copy of ["Paper Plane Instructions"][link-manual].
  2. Follow the instructions to make a paper plane. Record the entire process.  
     You want to follow it verbatim, even if you think it is nonsense.  
     Forget all your prior knowledge if there is any.  
     We offer ZERO explanations, and you should ONLY use this manual.  
  3. Upload your recording to a video-sharing website and share the video link.
     Make sure you note your background (major, etc.)!    
     Feel free to complain as much as you want to.
  4. Spread this to let more people involve!

## STEM?

Acronym of "Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics".  

Examples of STEM majors:

  - Physics
  - Computer Science/Engineering, Electric Engineering
  - Biology/Bioengineering
  - Mathematics

Examples of non-STEM majors:
  
  - Visual/Fine Art, Musics
  - History
  - Philosophy
  - Business

If you are in middle or high school, that counts as non-STEM.
